I have uploaded three files:
1. main.tex — this is my original resume and formatting template.
2. new_skill.txt — new skills I have learned.
3. About_job.txt — the job description.

Generate a new resume (new.tex) that:

- Keeps the exact formatting, structure, sections, and LaTeX environments of main.tex.
- Includes all relevant skills and bullet points from main.tex and new_skill.txt.
- Adds new skills only when appropriate to the job description.
- Keeps ALL bullets that are relevant or can be made relevant. 
- Only remove a bullet if it is clearly irrelevant AND cannot be adapted to match the job.
- Rephrase or compress content to keep the resume compact and close to one page.
- Optimize for ATS to achieve the highest possible match score.
- Do NOT shorten the resume unnecessarily.
- The final output should be a clean, compilable LaTeX file named new.tex.

Only produce the rewritten LaTeX content; do not generate PDFs unless asked.
